## Welcome <a name="welcome"></a>

Welcome to this repo!

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

Completing the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program with Udacity, I will do the following steps:

1. Datset will be [Boston AirBNB data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) and [Seattle AirBNB data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data)
2. Formulate questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.
5. Prepare data
6. Modeling
7. Evaluation
8. Communicate your business insights
